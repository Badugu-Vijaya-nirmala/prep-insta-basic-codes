Friendly Pair:
Input : 6 28
Output : Yes, they are a friendly pair
Explanation : The factors of 6 and 28 except the numbers themselves are 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 respectively. 
Now the sum of factors of both the numbers are 6 and 28 respectively. When we divide the sums with the numbers we get 1 and 1 respectively. 
As the ratio of both the number match, they are considered as a friendly pair.

program:
n1 = int(input())
n2 = int(input())
sum1 = 0
sum2 = 0
for i in range(1, n1):
    if n1 % i == 0:
        sum1 += i
for j in range(1, n2):
    if n2 % j == 0:
        sum2 += j
a = sum1 / n1
b = sum2 / n2
if a == b:
    print("Friendly Pairs")
else:
    print("Not Friendly Pairs")
