Abundant Number:
Input : Number = 12
Output : Yes, It's an Abundant Number
Explanation : The Factors for the number 12 are, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. We don't want to include the number itself. 
Now the sum of the factors except the number itself is : 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 as the number 16>12 , the number itself. It's an abundant number.

program:
n = int(input())
sum=1
for i in range(2,n):
  if(n%i==0):
   sum=sum+i
if(sum>n):
  print('Abundant Number')
else:
  print('not Abundant Number')
